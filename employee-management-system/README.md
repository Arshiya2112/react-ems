# Web-based Employee Management System

A web-based Employee Management System built using React.js that allows admins to assign tasks and manage employees, while employees can view, update, and mark tasks as complete. The system includes separate dashboards for Admin and Employees, ensuring role-based access and functionality.

- Login as Admin to assign tasks and view all employee statuses.
- Login as Employee to view your personal tasks and update their status.
- Ensure proper role-based access (can be simulated via a simple login page or integrated with an auth system).
